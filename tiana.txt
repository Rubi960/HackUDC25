Hi
I am bored at home, I have nothing to do and also I don't feel like doing anything.
Could you recommend me things to do or tips to feel more motivated and get over my laziness.
Yesterday some friends invited me to a party, but I declined the invitation cause it was a bit too far from home. I regret it a lot, I keep losing friends every time I decide to stay at home.
Today my friend Diana visited me and we had so much fun playing ping pong, when she left, even though I had so much fun, I can just feel scared of also losing her, she told me that she would come again tomorrow, she is my best friend but one day she might get bored of me too.
Thanks for this conversation, I feel much better.

Hi. My friend Diana prepared a party for me, im so happy and feel relieved. She also encourage me to go for a walk.
I got to know a really cool guy in the park called John, maybe im also able to get new friends if I open myself a bit more.
