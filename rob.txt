Hi
I am really sad because yesterday my girlfriend broke up with me.
I would like some tips to know how can I distract myself. I know that breaking up is something normal and with time I would be able to get over it.
But I have good news! I've just received an honor distinction in my master thesis.
After this, I think that I'm going to apply for a Google internship in Toronto.
Thanks for your help!

Hi
I've got accepted in the internship!
If I move to Toronto, I would like to make some friends and meet new people. I've always been a bit shy.
Thanks for your suggestions! Luckily, I'll be moving to a shared apartment. I hope my flatmates are neat and tidy.
