Hi
A friend of mine recommended me this assistant, I don't really need help, I'm happy and capable of everything, probably the best user you ever have.
Some people call me ego, but I don't really care, im the best they are just jealous. I don't have much friends, but that's normal, I'm super focused on myself and giving it all to improve every single day.
You didn't help me, but thanks for the chat.

Hi again.
Im not sure if I'm a good person, today I decided to think more about myself.
People only stay around me because I'm good at sports and my grades are great, but none of them really wants to talk to me.
Today a kid tripped and I laughed at him, people around me were hesitant at first but ended up laughing to copy me, I think that was horrible.
Next time something like that happens I will do better.
What else do you think I should do to improve as a person?
