Hi.
I had a serious problem with my family.
I told my grandparents that I am homosexual and they did not take it in good part.
My parents and my brother are still supportive with my situation, but I feel guilty because now our relationship with my grandparents would be worse.
Thank you so much for your help.

Hi! I have good news!
I've met a new girl at the office and she is really pretty and funny.
I think I might like her. I'm still sad about what happened with my grandparents but this helps me stay positive about my life.
I would like to approach her and see if we can meet each other after work :D

Hi again! The girl I mentioned you likes me to! I need to plan a date with her.
Yep. I was trying to arrange some picnic in the beach and then go to have dinner together to a fancy restaurant. What do you thing? Also, should I bring flowers?
I am quite nervous.
thanks for your advice!
